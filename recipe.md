1. Fill a large saucepan with water, put the lid on and bring to the boil over a high heat.
2. Add a good pinch of sea salt.
3. Once the water is boiling, stir in the pasta.
4. Cook the pasta according to the packet instructions. To tell if your pasta is cooked, try a piece about a minute or so before the end of the cooking time. It’s ready when it’s soft enough to eat, but still has a bit of bite. The Italians say ‘al dente’.
5.Scoop out a mugful of the starchy cooking water and set aside. This will help emulsify the pasta sauce.
6.Drain the pasta in a colander over the sink. Now it’s ready to toss through your favourite sauce – it’s best to do this in the pan, adding splashes of cooking water and mixing as you go until your sauce coats the pasta and is the perfect consistency.
